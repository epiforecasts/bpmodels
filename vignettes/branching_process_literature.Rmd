Below, we provide a bibliography on the application of branching processes to 
infectious disease modelling. 

It is our intention to grow this list to serve as a point of reference for 
budding modellers with an interest in the subject. 

If you would like to extend this list, the easiest way would be to [file an issue](https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels/issues/new/choose), listing the
new additions and we'll take it from there,
or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/epiforecasts/bpmodels/pulls) 
with an updated version of the bibliography file found in 
"vignettes/branching_process_literature.json".
