_bpmodels_ provides methods to analyse and simulate the size and length of branching processes with an arbitrary offspring distribution.
In this vignette we lay out the mathematical concepts behind the functionality available
in the package.

# Branching processes

[Branching processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process) are a class of models that are used to model the growth of populations where the number of offspring $Z$ that each member of the population has is a random variable following a given probability distribution with probability mass function $p(Z = z | \theta)$, the _offspring distribution_.
Their use has a long history in epidemiology, where the population is interpreted as a pathogen, and the offspring as new hosts that it infects [@farrington2003].
Below we will call these infected individuals _cases_ but the methods could be applied in other contexts where branching processes are to be used.

# Simulation

To simulate from a branching process, we start with a single case and proceed in discrete steps or generations, drawing from $p(Z=z | \theta)$ to generate new cases from each case.

If we additionally define the distribution of times $T$ as a random variable with distribution $f(T = t; \theta)$ we can assign each case $j$ a time $t_{j}$ which, if case $j$ has been affected by case $i$ is given by $f(t_{j} - t_{i} | \theta)$.
If we identify the timing cases by the time of their symptom onset this is the [serial interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_interval), but depending on case definitions this could be another interval.

## Summary statistics

To summarise the simulation of a branching process after it has ended (either because it has gone extinct or because of some stopping criterion) we either study the _size_ or _length_ of the resulting _chain_ of cases.
The size $S$ of a chain is the number of cases that have occurred over the course of the simulation including the initial case so that $S \geq 1$.
The length $L$ of a chain is the number of generations that have been simulated including the initial case so that $L \geq 1$.

# Inference

By characterising a chains of cases by their size of length we can conduct inference to learn about the underlying parameters $\theta$ from observation of chain sizes or chain lengths [@blumberg2013].
In general this is only possible for _subcritical_ branching processes, i.e. ones where the mean number of offspring is less than 1, as otherwise the branching process could grow forever.
However, we can expand the theory to _supercritical_ branching processes, i.e. ones where the mean number of offspring is greater than 1, by defining a cutoff of chain size or length beyond which we treat the chain as if it had infinite size or length, respectively.

## Size and length distributions for some offspring distributions

We show the equations for the size and length distributions for some offspring distributions where they can be derived analytically:
[Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution),
[negative binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution),
[geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution),
and a [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution)-[Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_distribution) mixture.

### Negative binomial and special cases

If the offspring distribution is a Poisson distribution, we can interpret its rate parameter $\lambda$ as the basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ of the pathogen.
In the more general case where the offspring definition can be _overdispersed_ leading to _superspreading_ we can use a negative binomial offspring distribution with mean $\mu$ and overdispersion $k$ [@lloyd-smith2005, @blumberg2013].
In that case, the mean parameter $\mu$ is interpreted as the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the pathogen.
The negative binomial distribution arises from a Poisson-gamma mixture and thus a branching process with negative binomial distributed offspring can be interpreted as one with Poisson distributed offspring where the basic reproduction number $R_0$ itself varies according to a gamma distribution.
The amount of variation in $R_0$ is then interpreted as individual-level variation in transmission representing overdispersion or superspreading, and the degree to which this happens is given by the overdispersion parameter $k$.

#### Size distributions

The probability $p$ of a chain of size $S$ given $R_0$ and $k$ in a branching process with negative binomial offspring distribution is given in Eq. 9 of @blumberg2013

$$
p(S|R_0, k) = \frac{\Gamma(kS + S - 1)}{\Gamma(kS)\Gamma(S + 1)} \frac{\left(\frac{R_0}{k}\right)^{S - 1}}{\left( 1 + \frac{R_0}{k} \right)^{kS + S - 1}}
$$

where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function.
In order to estimate $S$ from a given $R_0$ and $k$ we can define a likelihood function $L(S) = p(S|R_0, k)$.
The corresponding log-likelihood is

\begin{align}
\mathrm{LL}(S) = &\log\Gamma(kS + S  - 1) - \left(\log\Gamma(kS) + \log\Gamma(S - 1) \right) \\
& + (S-1) \log \frac{R_0}{k} - (SR_0 + (S - 1)) \log \left(1 + \frac{R_0}{k}\right)
\end{align}

The log-likelihood for Poisson distributed offspring follows from this where $k$ tends to infinity (corresponding to Eq. 2.2 in @farrington2003)

$$
\mathrm{LL}(S) = (S - 1) \log R_0 - S R_0 + (S - 2) \log S - \log\Gamma(S)
$$

In all cases the point estimate for the basic reproduction number $\hat{R_0}$ is related to the mean chain size $\bar{S}$ by

$$
\hat{R_0} = 1 - \frac{1}{\bar{S}}
$$

#### Length distributions

The cumulative mass function $F(L)$ of observing a chain of length $L$ when offspring is Poisson distributed is given by Eq. (2.5) in @farrington2003 (there called "outbreak duration"):

$$
F(L) = e^{-R_0} E_L \left( e^{R_0 e^{-R_0} } \right)
$$

where $E_L(x)$ is the iterated exponential function, $E_0(x) = 1$, $E_{L + 1}(x) = x^{E_L(x)}$.

For geometric distributed offspring (corresponding to a negative Binomial with $k=1$) this function is given by

$$
F(L) = \frac{ 1- R_0^{L + 1} } {1 - R_0^{L - 2}}
$$

In both cases $f(L)$ denotes cumulative mass functions and therefore the probability of observing a chain of length $L$ is therefore $f(L) - f(L - 1)$.

## Gamma-Borel mixture

The probability distribution of outbreak sizes from a branching process with a Poisson offspring distribution (Eq. 2.2 in @farrington2003) is a special case of the [Borel-Tanner distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_distribution#Borel%E2%80%93Tanner_distribution) starting with 1 individual.
An alternative to the negative binomial offspring distribution which represents a Poisson-gamma mixture is a Borel-gamma mixture.
This could represent situations where the variation is not at the _individual level_ but at the _chain level_, i.e. transmission chains is homogeneous but there is heterogeneity between chains.
In that case, it can be shown that the resulting log-likelihood of chain sizes is

\begin{align}
\mathrm{LL}(S) = &\log\Gamma(k + S - 1) - \left(\log\Gamma(k) + \log\Gamma(S + 1) \right) \\
& + (S-1) \log S - k \log \left(S + \frac{R_0}{k}\right)
\end{align}

## Size and length distributions for arbitrary offspring distributions

The analytic likelihoods stated above are included in the package and used when the corresponding offspring distributions are given.
In order to do this, the simulation functionality is be used to generate $n$ simulated chains and the value of the cumulative mass function $P(S|\theta)$ at the observed $S$ approximated by the empirical cumulative distribution function:
$$
P(S|\theta) \approx \sum_i \mathbf{1}(x_i <= S)
$$
where $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function and $x_i$ the i-th observed chain size (or length, if the interest is in $L$).
In order to improve this approximation a linear approximation is applied to the values of the empirical distribution function (at the expense of normalisation to 1).

The (unnormalised) probability of observing $S$ is then given by
$$
p(S|\theta) = P(S|\theta) - P(S - 1|\theta)
$$
and a an equivalent relationship is used for $L$.
