## Overview

Branching processes can be used to project infectious disease trends in time 
provided we can characterize the distribution of times between 
successive cases (serial interval), and the distribution of secondary cases 
produced by a single individual (offspring distribution). Such simulations can 
be achieved in `epichains` with the `chain_sim()` function and @pearson2020, and 
@abbott2020 illustrate its application to COVID-19. 

The purpose of this vignette is to use early data on COVID-19 in South Africa 
[@marivate2020] to illustrate how `epichains` can be used to forecast an 
outbreak. 

Let's load the required packages

```{r packages, include=TRUE}
library("epichains")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("lubridate")
library("epiparameter")
```

## Data

Included in `epichains` is a cleaned time series of the first 15 days of 
the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa. This can be loaded into 
memory as follows: 
```{r}
data("covid19_sa", package = "epichains")
```

Let us examine the first 6 entries of the dataset.
```{r}
head(covid19_sa)
```

## Setting up the inputs  

### Onset times 

`chain_sim()` requires a vector of onset times, `t0`, for each 
chain/individual/simulation. 

The `covid19_sa` dataset above is aggregated, so we will have to disaggregate
it into a linelist with each row representing a case and their onset time. 

To achieve this, we will first use the date of the index case as the reference 
and find the difference between each date and the reference. 
```{r linelist_gen, message=FALSE}
days_since_index <- as.integer(covid19_sa$date - min(covid19_sa$date))
days_since_index
```

Using the vector of start times for the time series, we will then 
create the linelist by disaggregating the time series so 
that each case has a corresponding start time.
```{r}
start_times <- unlist(mapply(
  function(x, y) rep(x, times = ifelse(y == 0, 1, y)),
  days_since_index,
  covid19_sa$cases
))

start_times
```

### Serial interval

The log-normal distribution is commonly used in epidemiology to characterise 
quantities such as the serial interval because it has a large variance 
and can only be positive-valued [@nishiura2007; @limpert2001]. 

In this example, we will assume based on COVID-19 literature that the 
serial interval, S, is log-normal distributed with parameters, 
$\mu = 4.7$ and $\sigma = 2.9$ [@pearson2020]. Note that when the distribution
is described this way, it means $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the expected value 
and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the serial interval. Hence, 
in order to sample the "back-transformed" measured serial interval with 
expectation/mean, $E[S]$ and standard deviation, $SD [S]$, 
we can use the following parametrisation:

\begin{align}
E[S] &= \ln \left( \dfrac{\mu^2}{(\sqrt{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}} \right) \\

SD [S] &= \sqrt {\ln \left(1 + \dfrac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2} \right)}
 
\end{align}

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) for a 
detailed explanation of this parametrisation.

The [epiparameter](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter) R package 
provides the function `epiparameter::lnorm_meansd2meanlogsdlog()` for implementing 
this parametrisation. It takes as inputs the mean, $\mu$ and standard 
deviation, $\sigma$ and returns a list with the transformed mean and 
standard deviation. Refer to `?epiparameter::lnorm_meansd2meanlogsdlog` 
for more details.

Let us set up the serial interval function with the appropriate inputs:
```{r input_prep3, message=FALSE}
mu <- 4.7
sgma <- 2.9

log_mean <- lnorm_meansd2meanlogsdlog(mu, sgma)[[1]]  # log mean
log_sd <- lnorm_meansd2meanlogsdlog(mu, sgma)[[2]] # log sd

#' serial interval function
serial_interval <- function(sample_size) {
  si <- rlnorm(sample_size, meanlog = log_mean, sdlog = log_sd)
  return(si)
}
```

### Offspring distribution

The negative binomial distribution is commonly used in epidemiology to
account for individual variation in transmissibility, 
also known as superspreading [@lloyd-smith2005].

For this example, we will assume that the offspring distribution is 
characterised by a negative binomial with $R = 2.5$ [@abbott2020] and 
$k = 0.58$ [@wang2020]. In this parameterization, $R$ 
represents the $R_0$, which is defined as the average number of 
cases produced by a single individual in an entirely susceptible population. 
The parameter $k$ represents superspreading, that is, the degree of 
heterogeneity in transmission by single individuals.

### Simulation controls

`chain_sim()` also requires the end time for the simulations. For this 
example, we will simulate outbreaks that end 14 days after the last date 
of observations in `covid19_sa`.   
```{r input_prep2, message=FALSE}
#' Date to end simulation (14 day projection in this case)
projection_window <- 14 # 14 days/ 2-week ahead projection
projection_end_day <- max(days_since_index) + projection_window
projection_end_day
```

`chain_sim()` is stochastic, meaning the results are different every 
time it is run for the same set of parameters, so we will run the simulations
many times and summarise the results. 

We will, therefore, run each simulation $100$ times.
```{r}
#' Number of simulations
sim_rep <- 100
```

Lastly, `chain_sim()` requires the maximum size of each chain. 
Above this value, the simulation is cut off. If this value is 
not specified, it assumes a value of infinity. Here, we will
assume a maximum chain size of $1000$.
```{r}
#' Maximum chain size allowed
chain_threshold <- 1000
```

## Modelling assumptions

`chain_sim()` makes the following simplifying assumptions:

1. All cases are observed
1. There is no reporting delay
1. Reporting rate is constant through the course of the epidemic
1. No interventions have been implemented
1. Population is homogeneous and well-mixed

To summarise the whole set up so far, we are going to simulate 
each chain `r sim_rep` times, projecting COVID-19 cases over
`r projection_window` days after the first $15$ days, and 
assuming that no outbreak size exceeds `r chain_threshold` cases. 

## Running the simulations

We will use the function `lapply()` to run the simulations and bind them
by rows with `dplyr::bind_rows()`.
```{r simulations, message=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
sim_chain_sizes <- lapply(
  seq_len(sim_rep),
  function(sim) {
    chain_sim(
      n = length(start_times),
      offspring = "nbinom",
      mu = 2.5,
      size = 0.58,
      stat = "size",
      infinite = chain_threshold,
      serial = serial_interval,
      t0 = start_times,
      tf = projection_end_day,
      tree = TRUE
    ) %>%
      mutate(sim = sim)
  }
)

sim_output <- bind_rows(sim_chain_sizes)
```

Let us view the first few rows of the simulation results.
```{r sim_output_head}
head(sim_output)
```

## Post-processing

Now, we will summarise the simulation results. 

We want to plot the individual simulated daily time series and show 
the median cases per day aggregated over all simulations.

First, we will create the daily time series per simulation by
aggregating the number of cases per day of each simulation.
```{r post_processing}
# Daily number of cases for each simulation
incidence_ts <- sim_output %>%
  mutate(day = ceiling(time)) %>%
  group_by(sim, day) %>%
  summarise(cases = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

head(incidence_ts)
```

Next, we will add a date column to the results of each simulation 
set. We will use the date of the first case in the observed data 
as the reference start date.
```{r}
# Get start date from the observed data
index_date <- min(covid19_sa$date)
index_date

# Add a dates column to each simulation result
incidence_ts_by_date <- incidence_ts %>%
  group_by(sim) %>%
  mutate(date = index_date + days(seq(0, n() - 1))) %>%
  ungroup()

head(incidence_ts_by_date)
```

Now we will aggregate the simulations by day and evaluate the median 
daily cases across all simulations.
```{r}
# Median daily number of cases aggregated across all simulations
median_daily_cases <- incidence_ts %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(median_cases = median(cases)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(day)

head(median_daily_cases)
```

As was done for the individual simulations, we will add a date column in the
same manner.
```{r}
# Add dates
median_daily_cases <- median_daily_cases %>%
  mutate(date = index_date + days(seq(0, projection_end_day))) %>%
  ungroup()

head(median_daily_cases)
```

## Visualization

We will now plot the individual simulation results alongside the median
of the aggregated results.

  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = cases,
      group = sim
    ),
    color = "grey",
    linewidth = 0.2,
    alpha = 0.25
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = median_daily_cases,
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = median_cases
    ),
    color = "tomato3",
    linewidth = 1.8
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = covid19_sa,
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = cases
    ),
    color = "black",
    size = 1.75,
    shape = 21
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = covid19_sa,
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = cases
    ),
    color = "black",
    size = 1.75,
    shape = 21
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(
      min(incidence_ts_by_date$date),
      max(incidence_ts_by_date$date),
      10
    ),
    labels = seq(
      min(incidence_ts_by_date$date),
      max(incidence_ts_by_date$date),
      10
    )
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(
      0,
      max(incidence_ts_by_date$cases) + 200,
      250
    ),
    labels = seq(
      0,
      max(incidence_ts_by_date$cases) + 200,
      250
    )
  ) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Daily cases (median)")
```
